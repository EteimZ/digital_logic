# Digital Logic

Implementation of digital logic circuit in python. The goal of this repo is to implement digital logic circuits in python that will serve as foundation of any other project that seeks to use the these circuit.

Currently the three fundamental gates have been implemented.
- AND
- OR
- NOT

Other gates which builds upon them have also been implemented like:
- Nand
- XOR
- XNOR

Arithmetic logics are currently being implemented.
